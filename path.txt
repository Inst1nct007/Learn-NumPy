Assignments

1. use the array() to create an array.

2. use array.shape to print the shape of an array

3. use array.size to print the size of an array

4. use arange(start, stop, skip) to create an array.

5. use the linspace(start, stop, no_of_elements) to create an evenly spaced array.

6. use the array.mean() to find the mean of an array.

7. use the array.std() to find the standard deviation of an array.

8. Multiply all the elements of an array by 10 and store it in a new array.

9. Print the first half and last half of an array.

10. Use the random() to store 10 random values between 0 and 1 in an array.

**Added Later**

Use the RandomState() with a seed to create random values that woudn't change.

11. Use the rand() to store random values in the shape (3,4)

12. Use the randint(start, stop, no_of_int) to store 9 random integers in an array between 10 and 20

13. Use the randn() store an array which is normally distributed

14. Use the zeros() to create an array of zeros in the shape (3, 4)

15. Take an array with even and odd numbers in it. Store only the even/odd numbers in another array.

16. Take an array from 10 to 20 with 40 values. Store only the numbers which are greater/lesser than 15

17. Using Matplotlib, plot a sin, cos, tan wave.

18. Use the np.vectorize() to find the first character of each element in an array of strings.

19. Use the np.vectorize() to find the elements ending with 't' . Add only those element into a new array.

20. Use np.gradient to find the roots of a function. i.e. where the dydx is 0.

21. Use the ravel() method to convert an n-dim array to an 1-d array.

22. In an 2d array

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Print only the elements in the first column

23. Convert a 2d array such that it's first row goes to last and last row comes to first.

Eg. Initial Array

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Final Array

[[7,8,9],
 [4,5,6],
 [1,2,3]]

24. Convert a 2d array such that it's first column goes to last and last column comes to first.

Eg. Initial Array

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Final Array

[[3,2,1],
 [6,5,4],
 [9,8,7]]

25. Given two arrays 

[1,2,3,4,5]

[6,7,8,9,10]

using the meshgrid() multiply each element of one array with the elements of the second array.

26. Convert a 2d array such that it's first row & column goes to last and last column and row comes to first.

Eg. Initial Array

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Final Array

[[9,8,7],
 [6,5,4],
 [3,2,1]]

27. WAP to transpose a matrix

Eg. Initial Matrix

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

Transposed Matrix

[[1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [3,6,9]]

28. Operations (+,-,*,/,%) between two arrays are only possible if their shapes are:

i. Either both the same no.

ii. One of them is 1

Eg. 1

shape of arr1 = (2,5,1,4,7)

shape of arr2 = (2,5,6,1,7)

Operations are POSSIBLE

Eg. 2

shape of arr1 = (2,3,4)

shape of arr2 = (4,3,2)

Operations are not Possible

REMEMBER Given two matrices, their multiplication is only possible if:

i. Their shapes are (y,x) and (x,z)

ii. The shape of the solution will be (y,z)

29. Find the multiplication of two matrices

[[1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]]

[[1],
 [2],
 [3]]

30. Use the np.dot() to find the Scalar/dot product of two matrices

31. Use the np.cross() find the vector product of two matrices

32. Use the np.linalg.solve() to solve a given system of linear equations

33. Use the np.linalg.eig() to find the eigen values and the eigen vectors of an array

34. Use the reshape() to change the shape of an array.

35. Use ndim to find the dimension of an array.
